## Unique Value Proposition

Self sovereign identities and verifiable credentials are the core feature of SuperLancersZK, and we are leveraging Flare network and Scaffold-Eth to make it possible to mint NFT credentials on-chain in a decentralized and transparent manner. Our digital reputation framework uses Aztec Token Bridge to preserve privacy in payments, invoicing and encourage anonymous feedback.

These features work well together to create a reimagined workplace for the on-chain future.


## Problems We're Solving

40% of people lie on their resumes, and three out of four employers have caught a lie on someone's resume. With on-chain actions in SuperLancersZK leaving a digital trail for everyone's skills and activities, SuperLancersZK offer a tamper-proof credentials where organizations can make sure that user profiles are always accurate and truthful.

Discovering talent online and finding the right person to do a task for you is not always easy. SuperLancersZK facilitates talent matching by providing the community an accurate, reliable and searchable representation of real time freelancer qualifications and professional development.

The existing prominent gig marketplaces are centralized, which could lead to concerns surrounding the public disclosure of one's income and personal information. SuperLancersZK addresses and resolves this particular challenge by offering a decentralised gig marketplace.

## Public and Private payment methods
 SuperLancersZK supports both public and private payments.

----------------------------------------------------------------
### Private Payment methods
### Why we need it ?
- Privacy concerns in professional networks and marketplaces
- Need for efficient matching and discovery without compromising privacy
- Inadequate security and privacy in payment infrastructure

### Public methods
 Public payments are made through on-chain contracts.
#### How it works

1. Freelancer signs up and writes a basic description and skills list to attract potential clients. There is no credentials on his/her profile yet, because it will only be filled through NFTs issued by verified organizations.

2. He/She then applies for 'Quests' from the list of Gigs. The organization funds the escrow before awarding the job to him/her.

3. Lancer submits his/her work by marking the quest completed, which then sends an invoice to the org via Request Network. If approved by the Org, the escrow is released and the platform mints an NFT credential to the Lancer which is then displayed in his/her profile.


----------------------------------------------------------------

SuperLancersZK is leading the way in reimagining the freelancing landscape by prioritizing privacy, accuracy, and user experience. Join us on this innovative journey as we revolutionize on-chain work environments and empower users with a trustless, private, and secure platform.
